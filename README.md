## What is Formulaic

Formulaic is a fairly advanced calculator, that can support drawing of basic graphical expressions, alongside normal operations such as addition, substraction, etc. I initially programmed it in 2014 to further my knowledge as a newly minted Java programmer, to put into practice what I had learned and push myself to learn more concepts such as UI design using the Swing library.

Recently, I have made some small changes to the code, that include the graphing of simple expressions (that I had initially not covered), saving and loading history and proof-reading some parts of the code that had errors. However, it still needs a lot more work, specially in expression assignment & graphing. Having said that, I am proud of what I have managed to accomplish so far here, and will be looking to expand on it in the future, to incorporate better concepts such as modularity in design and further complexity of operations.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the code, complie it and run. It would be better to use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA. The `Help.txt` file consists of basic instructions on how to use Fomulaic. `FormulaicDiagram.png` provides a simple illustration of Formulaic, whereas `FormulaicScreenshot.png` provides a screeeshot.

## Further Information

I, at the moment, do not plan to give more time to Formulaic. However, I do plan to return to it at some stage, to play around with it's potential. I will not be able to assist with any bugs/issues, presently, but would love and encourage any and all feedback.

Without explicit consent from myself, no modifications should be made to the code, and it should not be incorporated into any other program/projects.
